In this notebook, you will learn how to use the Unity ML-Agents environment for the first project of the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).

### 1. Start the Environment

We begin by importing some necessary packages.  If the code cell below returns an error, please revisit the project instructions to double-check that you have installed [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/).


```python
from unityagents import UnityEnvironment
import numpy as np
```

Next, we will start the environment!  **_Before running the code cell below_**, change the `file_name` parameter to match the location of the Unity environment that you downloaded.

- **Mac**: `"path/to/Banana.app"`
- **Windows** (x86): `"path/to/Banana_Windows_x86/Banana.exe"`
- **Windows** (x86_64): `"path/to/Banana_Windows_x86_64/Banana.exe"`
- **Linux** (x86): `"path/to/Banana_Linux/Banana.x86"`
- **Linux** (x86_64): `"path/to/Banana_Linux/Banana.x86_64"`
- **Linux** (x86, headless): `"path/to/Banana_Linux_NoVis/Banana.x86"`
- **Linux** (x86_64, headless): `"path/to/Banana_Linux_NoVis/Banana.x86_64"`

For instance, if you are using a Mac, then you downloaded `Banana.app`.  If this file is in the same folder as the notebook, then the line below should appear as follows:
```
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana.app")
```


```python
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana.app")
```

    INFO:unityagents:

            Number of stacked Vector Observation: 1
            Vector Action space type: discrete
            Vector Action space size (per agent): 4
            Vector Action descriptions: , , , 


Environments contain **_brains_** which are responsible for deciding the actions of their associated agents. Here we check for the first brain available, and set it as the default brain we will be controlling from Python.


```python
# get the default brain
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]
```

### 2. Examine the State and Action Spaces

The simulation contains a single agent that navigates a large environment.  At each time step, it has four actions at its disposal:
- `0` - walk forward 
- `1` - walk backward
- `2` - turn left
- `3` - turn right

The state space has `37` dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  A reward of `+1` is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of `-1` is provided for collecting a blue banana. 

Run the code cell below to print some information about the environment.


```python
# reset the environment
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

# number of agents in the environment
print('Number of agents:', len(env_info.agents))

# number of actions
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size
print('Number of actions:', action_size)

# examine the state space 
state = env_info.vector_observations[0]
print('States look like:', state)
state_size = len(state)
print('States have length:', state_size)
```

    Number of agents: 1
    Number of actions: 4
    States look like: [1.         0.         0.         0.         0.84408134 0.
     0.         1.         0.         0.0748472  0.         1.
     0.         0.         0.25755    1.         0.         0.
     0.         0.74177343 0.         1.         0.         0.
     0.25854847 0.         0.         1.         0.         0.09355672
     0.         1.         0.         0.         0.31969345 0.
     0.        ]
    States have length: 37


### 3. Take Random Actions in the Environment

In the next code cell, you will learn how to use the Python API to control the agent and receive feedback from the environment.

Once this cell is executed, you will watch the agent's performance, if it selects an action (uniformly) at random with each time step.  A window should pop up that allows you to observe the agent, as it moves through the environment.  

Of course, as part of the project, you'll have to change the code so that the agent is able to use its experience to gradually choose better actions when interacting with the environment!


```python
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=False)[brain_name] # reset the environment
state = env_info.vector_observations[0]            # get the current state
score = 0                                          # initialize the score
while True:
    action = np.random.randint(action_size)        # select an action
    env_info = env.step(action)[brain_name]        # send the action to the environment
    next_state = env_info.vector_observations[0]   # get the next state
    reward = env_info.rewards[0]                   # get the reward
    done = env_info.local_done[0]                  # see if episode has finished
    score += reward                                # update the score
    state = next_state                             # roll over the state to next time step
    if done:                                       # exit loop if episode finished
        break
    
print("Score: {}".format(score))
```

    Score: 0.0


When finished, you can close the environment.


```python
env.close()
```

## 4. It's Your Turn!

Now it's your turn to train your own agent to solve the environment!  When training the environment, set `train_mode=True`, so that the line for resetting the environment looks like the following:
```python
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]
```

### 4.1 Perform the necessary imports.

#### This line is where we import the unityagents UnityEnvironment class. This class is our controller for running the environment.


```python
from unityagents import UnityEnvironment
```

#### The statement import numpy as np, we are shortening the phrase "numpy" to "np" to make our code easier to read. It also helps to avoid namespace issues.


```python
import numpy as np
```

#### Import torch package for defining the model and optimization methods


```python
import torch                              # root package
import torch.nn as nn                     # neural networks
import torch.nn.functional as F           # layers, activations and more
import torch.optim as optim               # optimizers e.g. gradient descent, ADAM, etc.
```


```python
import random
from collections import namedtuple, deque
```

### 4.2 Launch Unity window showing the environment

#### We can see an output showing successful start up and brain stats.


```python
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana.app")
```

### 4.3 Setting the brain

#### Environments contain brains which are responsible for deciding the actions of their associated agents. Here we check for the first brain available, and set it as the default brain we will be controlling from Python.


```python
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]
```

###  4.4 Define a neural network architecture that maps states to action values.

A neural network has 3 Linear layers with 64 nodes each. I am using relu as activation function.


```python
class QNetwork(nn.Module):
    """Actor (Policy) Model."""

    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, seed, fc1_units=64, fc2_units=64):
        """Initialize parameters and build model.
        Params
        ======
            state_size (int): Dimension of each state
            action_size (int): Dimension of each action
            seed (int): Random seed
            fc1_units (int): Number of nodes in first hidden layer
            fc2_units (int): Number of nodes in second hidden layer
        """
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.seed = torch.manual_seed(seed)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, fc1_units)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(fc1_units, fc2_units)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(fc2_units, action_size)

    def forward(self, state):
        """Build a network that maps state -> action values."""
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(state))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)
```

### 4.5 Create agent class

#### Interacts with and learns from the environment

Function __init__ initializes an Agent object, by initializing two identical neural networks.

Function step saves experience in replay memory, by adding data to replay buffer.

Function act returns actions for given state as per current policy, by obtaining actiion_values from self.qnetwork_local and checking eps which is responsible for exploration and exploitation ratio. If the value is greater then eps then maximum value from action_values(exploitation) is used, if not, the choice is random from action space.

Function learn updates value parameters using given batch of experience tuples. Q_targets_next gets max predicted Q values (for next states) from target model. Q_targets computes Q targets for current states. Gamma is a discount factor that makes future rewards less significant. calculate Q_expected gets expected Q values from local model. Optimisation helps Q_expected and Q_targets to come closer.

Function soft_update performs soft update model parameters, by coping parameters from q_network_local and q_network_target according to tau coefficient to `q_network_target.
        θ_target = τ*θ_local + (1 - τ)*θ_target



```python
class Agent():
    """Interacts with and learns from the environment."""

    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, seed):

### 4.6 Create ReplayBuffer class

It is a fixed-size buffer to store experience tuples. Its purpose is to keep history of different states, actions, rewards, next states and dones. add function adds data from the agent to the replay buffer. sample function gets random sample of data for the agent. We use random sample because we don't want our agent to memorize sequences.


```python
class ReplayBuffer:
    """Fixed-size buffer to store experience tuples."""

    def __init__(self, action_size, buffer_size, batch_size, seed):
        """Initialize a ReplayBuffer object.

        """Add a new experience to memory."""
        e = self.experience(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        self.memory.append(e)
    
    def sample(self):
        """Randomly sample a batch of experiences from memory."""
        experiences = random.sample(self.memory, k=self.batch_size)

        states = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e.state for e in experiences if e is not None])).float().to(device)
        actions = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e.action for e in experiences if e is not None])).long().to(device)
        rewards = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e.reward for e in experiences if e is not None])).float().to(device)
        next_states = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e.next_state for e in experiences if e is not None])).float().to(device)
        dones = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e.done for e in experiences if e is not None]).astype(np.uint8)).float().to(device)
  
        return (states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones)

    def __len__(self):
        """Return the current size of internal memory."""
        return len(self.memory)
```

### 4.7 Tuning hyperparameters.

BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e5) - buffer size parameters.

BATCH_SIZE = 64 - batch size controls how often our neural network updates gradients.

GAMMA = 0.99 - is the discount factor (0≤γ≤1) - determines how much importance we want to give to future rewards. A high value for the discount factor (close to 1) captures the long-term effective award, whereas, a discount factor of 0 makes our agent consider only immediate reward, hence making it greedy.

TAU = 1e-3 - soft update of target parameters
LR = 5e-4 - is the learning rate (0<α≤1) - Just like in supervised learning settings, α is the extent to which our Q-values are being updated in every iteration.

UPDATE_EVERY = 4 - how often our network updates.



```python
BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e5)  # replay buffer size
BATCH_SIZE = 64         # minibatch size
GAMMA = 0.99            # discount factor
TAU = 1e-3              # for soft update of target parameters
LR = 5e-4               # learning rate 
UPDATE_EVERY = 4        # how often to update the network
```

### 4.8 Setting the behavior that the model gets put on GPU if available and runs on CPU if there is no GPU.


```python
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
```

### 4.9 Instantiating Agent


```python
import random
from collections import namedtuple, deque
agent = Agent(state_size=37, action_size=4, seed=0)
print (agent)
```

    <__main__.Agent object at 0x111256358>

### 5. Ideas for future work

 Ideas for improving the agent's performance.
 
I can turn our hyperparameters pragramatically by creating a comprehensive search function (similar to grid search) that selects the parameters that would result in best reward/step ratio. The reason for reward/step is that we want to choose parameters which enable us to get the maximum reward as fast as possible. We also can track number of penalties corresponding to the hyperparameter value combination, because it could be a deciding factor. We can try to get the right combination of hyperparameter values would be to use [Genetic Algorithms](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-neuroevolution-genetic-algorithms-are-a-competitive-alternative-for-training-deep-neural-822bfe3291f5)

I can try different learning algorithms. I can try: 

Double DQN (Double Q-Learning helps with overestimating action values); 

Prioritized Experience Replay (Prioritized experienced samples more important transitions with higher probability.);

Dueling DQN (Dueling architecture allows to assess the value of each state, without having to learn the effect of each action.)


```python

```
